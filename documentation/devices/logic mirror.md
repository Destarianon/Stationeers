Requires 10W of power.

A logic mirror allows a device to be relayed from 1 cable network to another without combining the 2 networks together.

The logic mirror represents the device and presents all values and accepts all commands, relaying them to the original device.

BUG: The mogic mirror does not work with ls "load slot" commands, therefore it cannot mirror a device like a vending machine effectively.
