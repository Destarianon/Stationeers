General directory structure:

In progress - Code that is proof of concept or not yet functional

```

Any script name which includes `_EXTENDED` is utilizing the following 2 mods:
- [More lines of code](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3265272725)
  - Increases the IC10 line count to 512
- [Rapid Chips](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3414086228)
  - Increases the runspeed of IC10 chips, and allows more accurate timing control

Both of these mods require BepInEx and StationeersLaunchpad to function, as they are plugin mods.
